# Graph
## A Graph is a data structure composed of vertices and edges in a non-linear fashion. These are represented with nodes and lines respectively. 

## Types of Graph
### Directed Graph
- A Directed Graph is a Graph in which the edges have a specific direction towards a specifc connected vertex.
### Undirected Graph
- An Undirected Graph has its edges given no direction. These edges can can be traversed in any direction in any given connected vertex

## Features
### Directed Graph
- addVertex()
- addEdge()
- bfs()
### Undirected Graph
- addVertex()
- addEdge()
- bfs()
